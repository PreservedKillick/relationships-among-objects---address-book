Lesson:

Address book, continued

Start off by following along with the lesson to make an address book that will accept multiple phone numbers per contact.

Extend your address book to support phone numbers as well. A single contact should be able to have multiple phone numbers.

Create a method called .valid() on your Address and Phone objects to tell if the user entered valid information. Update your page to display an error if the information was invalid.
